TASK-01
World Population Data Visualization
Task 01: Visualizing Population Distribution

📄 Description
For this task, I was assigned to create a histogram and a bar chart to visualize the world population distribution using a dataset.

📊 Dataset
Sample Dataset: I selected the World Population Data from a CSV file. This dataset contains population statistics for different countries.

📌 Categorical Data Selection
I chose the Country column as the categorical data and the 2022 population values for analysis.

🔍 Data Analysis in Python
Data Cleaning: Dropped unnecessary columns, renamed relevant ones, and removed missing values.
Histogram: Used seaborn to create a histogram representing the distribution of population sizes.
Bar Chart: Selected a few countries to compare their populations visually.
🛠 Steps to Create the Visualization
🔹 Data Import: Loaded the world population dataset using pandas.
🔹 Data Cleaning: Removed unwanted columns and handled missing values.
🔹 Histogram Creation:

Plotted a histogram with 30 bins using seaborn.histplot().
Added a KDE curve for better visualization of the distribution.
🔹 Bar Chart Creation:
Selected key countries (United States, China, India, Brazil, Nigeria, Germany).
Used seaborn.barplot() to compare their population sizes.
🔹 Chart Customization: Added titles, axis labels, and color palettes for clarity.
📊 Output
The histogram effectively shows the distribution of population sizes, while the bar chart provides a direct comparison of selected countries' populations.

📈 Impact
This visualization helps in understanding:
✅ How population sizes are distributed across different countries.
✅ How major countries compare in terms of population.
✅ Insights into population density and potential growth trends.
